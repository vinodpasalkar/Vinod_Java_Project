public class AssociativeArray {
	//An associative array is a data type that associates a unique key with a particular value. Unlike an array, the key does not have to be a non-negative integer index. It could be a string, a character, or a number (including negative numbers), as long as the keys are unique values.

	//What data structure in Java most closely resembles an associative array?

	//A dequeue -- or double ended queue -- because dequeues are generalizations of queues and stacks, so that you can add and remove elements from either end.
	//A collection, because it is the most general data structure in the collection framework, and associative arrays are generalizations of arrays.
	//A map, because the key-value pairs in a map correspond to the key-value pairs in an associative array.
	//A sorted set, because sets enforce uniqueness of the keys, and the keys should be sorted in an associative array for efficient access.
